// Composite run length encoder
// ----------------------------
// Data is encoded in-place at the beginning of the input buffer.  The resulting
// encoded length is returned to the caller.  
//
// Whether or not the encoder encounters any run lengths, the resulting buffer is
// guaranteed to <= bufLen.
//
// A bitmask/prefix is applied to repeating bytes followed a numeric run length value up
// to 256 (1 byte).  Consequently, the prefix limits the available byte size to <= 0x7D.
// Run lengths longer than 256 bytes are broken into multiple encoded sets.
//
// Non-repeating characters are not considered by the encoder and are returned in their 
// original form without a trailing run length of 1 (as found in traditiona RLE).
//
// This combination creates composite form of run length encoding with with an overall 
// smaller size than standard run length encoding.
//
// This is ideal for encoding short arrays of values lower than 128 bits, making it a 
// good fit for serial transmission for CMS and possibly other things that are text-like
// in nature.
